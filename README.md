    - An infinite map generator algorithm that is a composite of a large-scale, OpenSimplex2 noise-based, zeta-tessellated, Kruskal maze of roads, a dungeon generator for each cell of the maze, and a low-scale OpenSimplex2 noise-based height map to fill the empty parts of the cell with mountain ranges and vegetation.
